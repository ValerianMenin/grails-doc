==== AngularJS Scaffolding

The `angular` profile has been refined and now also includes a new https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/angular-scaffolding[Angular Scaffolding] plugin.

The Angular scaffolding plugin adds an `ng-generate-all` command which will generate the necessary AngularJS 1.x client code to perform CRUD operations in conjunction with a Grails 3 backend.

Not only does this serve as a useful tool to get up and running quickly, but (like previous versions of scaffolding) it is a great way for developers to learn how to integrate AngularJS and Grails 3.

==== Angular 2 Profile (3.2.1+)

Starting with Grails 3.2.1, the Angular 2 profile is available for use. To create a fresh application:

[source,bash]
----
grails create-app test-ng -profile angular2
----

A multi-project build will be created with a separate project for the client and server applications. To make things easier, the tasks `test`, `integrationTest`, and `bootRun` have been created in the client application to make executing those tasks easier across the whole application.

Since Gradle executes tasks synchronously, and the `bootRun` task will never finish, it is important to execute it in parallel. At the root of the project:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun --parallel
----
For now, the `--parallel` option isn't activated anymore. You should prefer running both servers indididually like that:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew server:bootRun
./gradlew client:bootRun
----

This will start both the client and server side applications simultaneously.

For more information on how the new profile works, see the link:webServices.html#angular2Profile[section in the user guide].
